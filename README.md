My portfolio website

Lots of useless css and html left over after recreating the site from where it was originally designed on grapedrop. There also isn't any preliminary build step to clean up after me which doesn't help either. It's the reason why maintaining and updating this thing is pretty much impossible right now because it's so time consuming. Probs gonna rewrite in near future, maybe something with 3d effects as you scroll the page but seems like too much of a time investment rn especially since I don't have a clear vision of what I want (maybe a tower that climbs up as u scroll?). I also need to focus on finding an internship and/or an actual tech job.
