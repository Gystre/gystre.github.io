My portfolio website

Lots of useless css and html left over after recreating the site from where it was originally designed on grapedrop. It's the reason why updating this thing with new pages/features is pretty takes super long right now since it's so time consuming. Probably gonna rewrite in near future, maybe something with 3d effects and parallax scrolling but seems like too much of a time investment rn especially since I don't have a clear vision of what I want (maybe a tower that climbs up as u scroll?). I also need to focus on finding an internship and/or an actual SWE job lol
