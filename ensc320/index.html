                    <h2>üêß What are these things?</h2>
                    The Emperor Penguin is what everyone imagines a penguin to
                    look like, an aquatic flightless bird with black feathers on
                    the head and back, a white belly, yellow patches around the
                    ears, and a long sharp beak. They are are the tallest and
                    largest of the 18 penguin species in the world reaching up
                    to 39 inches in length and can weigh anywhere from 49 to 99
                    pounds.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <b>Where they live</b>
                    <br />
                    Being native to Antarctica, their bodies have evolved to
                    survive in the extreme weather with dense feathers and a
                    thick layer of fat to keep them warm as well as a
                    streamlined body and flipper turned wings to swim in the
                    water. To find their food, they dive into the water to eat
                    fish, krill, crustaceans, and cephalopods. Their predators
                    consist of birds on land and leopard seals and orcas in the
                    water.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <b>How they reproduce</b>
                    <br />
                    This penguin species in particular is special because they
                    only breed during the winter. At the start of the breeding
                    season (March and April), they go on long treks from 31-75
                    miles inland from the edge of the pack ice towards colonial
                    nesting areas and have 1 child per year per pair. After
                    laying the egg one parent will stay with it while the other
                    will go out to sea to hunt for food.

                    <h2>üå°Ô∏è How are they affected by climate change?</h2>
                    Humans have been pumping a substantial amount of carbon
                    emissions into the atmosphere for many decades. In 2020
                    alone, we put 5,981 million metric tons of carbon dioxide
                    equivalent emissions into the atmosphere. That's like the
                    weight of 6 billion cars in CO2! Who creates these emissions
                    is pretty evenly split across a few economic sectors with
                    the largest being transportation (27%) and electric power
                    (25%). These carbon emissions aren't taken out of the
                    atmosphere as fast as they are put up which creates what's
                    known as a greenhouse effect where the atmosphere traps heat
                    and warms up the planet and is the main driving factor in
                    global climate change and rising temperatures around the
                    world. According to the United States Environtmental
                    Protection Agency, we have taken strides in reducing these
                    emissions by 7% since 1990 compared to 2020's levels but
                    this by no means means that we still shouldn't be worrying
                    about the future.

                    As the global temperature increases due to climate change,
                    Antarctica's ice, the home of the penguins, continues to
                    melt rapidly. According to NASA, Antarctica has been losing
                    24 cubic miles of ice per year since 2002 and according to
                    the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, as much as 60% of
                    the sea ice has been reduced in 30 years with one colony
                    virtually disappearing. Since the penguins rely on the sea
                    ice for long term survival, this would mean less breeding
                    platforms for the penguins and increases the chance of early
                    ice break off before the chicks are ready to go to sea. A
                    study was done by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
                    where they modeled "the projected dynamics of all known
                    emperor penguin colonies under different greenhouse gas
                    emission scenarios" (Australian Antarctic Program).
                    According to this study, under the current emission rates
                    and it's effects on the ice, emperor penguin poplation
                    numbers will diminish slowly until about 2040 and if nothing
                    is done to curve emission rates, they will become quasi
                    extinct by 2100 as 98% of colonies would vanish.

                    <h2>üôå Why are they worth saving?</h2>
                    Ecosystems are delicate balancing games and if one species
                    of the huge food web becomes over/under populated it can
                    lead to echoing effects that break down the whole system.
                    The emperor penguin is a key animal in the antarctic
                    ecosystem, consuming the smaller animals like krill and fish
                    while becoming food for some of the top predators like seals
                    and whales. As their numbers decrease, the changes will
                    slowly affect the rest of the system as the predators that
                    feed on them die of starvation and the krill and fish that
                    the penguins feed on will become overpopulated, shifting the
                    balance of the entire ecosystem.

                    <h2>‚ù§ What we can do to help them</h2>
                    There are many different ways to help prevent the decline of
                    Emperor Penguins in the future and they mostly fall into 3
                    different catgories:
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <b>Indirect Solutions</b>
                    <br />
                    Indirect solutions are solutions that are expensive in terms
                    of time and money but act as a more long term solution to
                    the problem. The most obvious solution of the bunch is to
                    cut the problem at it's source by reducing carbon emissions
                    by cutting out short lived climate pollutants and switching
                    to renewable energy sources.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Some of the more creative solutions focus on fixing
                    Antarctica itself by preventing or slowing it's melt using
                    geoengineering. One proposed solution is to build large sea
                    walls to block warm water from rubbing against the bottom of
                    the glaciers and melting them. Another solution is to use
                    physical supports to prevent the collapse of ice sheets as
                    they melt avoiding a chain reaction effect. One last
                    solution is employ a form of water cooling where a hole is
                    drilled into the ice and cooled brine is pumped to the base
                    of a glacier, cooling it at the core. As you could probably
                    guess, these solutions would cost tens of billions of
                    dollars and tens of billions more to maintain every year.
                    However, the cost might not seem that bad compared to the
                    trillions of dollars it could save by not only protecting
                    Antarctica and it's sea life but also preventing further sea
                    level rise from the melted ice which is a real threat that
                    hundreds of coastal communities and major cities around the
                    world face.

                    <b>Direct Solutions</b>
                    <br />
                    Direct solutions are solutions that are much cheaper and
                    faster to implement but are not as effective in the long
                    run. One of these solutions is to limit or close fishing
                    grounds around penguin breeding colonies which would prevent
                    overfishing, leaving more food for the penguins, and
                    preventing the accidental capture of penguins. Another
                    solution is to hand rear chicks which means to save
                    abandoned or orphaned chicks in the wild before they die of
                    starvation and releasing them back once they grow up to the
                    age of a fledgling and can support themselves. Some of these
                    solutions are already being implemented with 7000
                    hand-reared chicks being saved since 2006 by the Southern
                    African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds.

                    Individual solutions are solutions that you and me can start
                    doing right now. It can seem hopeless reducing and
                    sacrificing our reliance on convenient products that are
                    harmful to the environment so it's important to make sure
                    that we are spending our time wisely and efficiently when it
                    comes to reducing carbon emissions. Small things that can
                    add up to make a big difference and don't take much time at
                    all can be as simple as buying from sustainable fisheries,
                    reducing plastic usage with a reusable shopping bag, and
                    recycling more often. A few things that can make a huge
                    impact are electing the right people who will pass laws that
                    work to solve climate change and helping out local
                    environmental groups to get others to join the cause.
